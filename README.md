# usage

1. dataProcess.m : extract patches from the MVS dataset
    
    or you can directly use the pre-extracted patches

<pre>
    dataProcess (run in matlab)
</pre>
    
2. extract.sh : extract features from patches by CNN-based models

    or you can directly use the pre-extracted features
    
<pre>
    bash extract.sh
</pre>
    
3. result.m : evaluate the features extractes by CNN-based models
